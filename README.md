# Hi there, I'm Joan ðŸ‘‹
I'm a UI/UX designer and product designer with years of experience designing user-friendly and visually appealing digital products that solve complex problems.

## My design philosophy
I believe that good design is not just about making things look pretty, but also about creating solutions that work seamlessly and efficiently for users. My approach to design is always user-centric and research-driven, starting with a deep understanding of the users' needs, pain points, and behaviors. I also value collaboration and open communication, and I enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams to bring ideas to life.

## My design skills
Here are some of the design skills and tools I'm proficient in:

- User research and analysis
- Information architecture and wireframing
- Prototyping and user testing
- Visual design and branding
- UI animation and interaction design
- Figma, Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite, InVision
